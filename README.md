# ESP8266_Load_Controller
This project is a sample load controller that uses MQTT and end-to-end AES-128 encryption to allow a Processing3 application to control a relay managed load with an ESP8266 on a NodeMCU Board.

Other than the ones included in this project, the additional libraries referenced are part of the following: https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/
